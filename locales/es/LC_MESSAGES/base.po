"            **This WebApp of Astrotool©** is a gift from **[Geometric Thinking](https://geometricthinking.com \"Geometric Thinking\")** and the developers **Amir & Sachith** to the world.  We have learned that there is a **unique way** to *read price charts* for geometric support and resistance.  **AND** we have found that there are ways to project, **far in advance, the dates when pivot turns are likely to occur in the market**. We call those dates **ENERGY POINTS (EPs)**.  This WebApp will highlight future EPS for you.  *It will not tell you which way a market will break*, but **it will give you a upindication when to pay close attention to a chart for price volatility**.\n"
"            * The **MAIN** page is absolutely full of key astrological data related to key dates in BTC history, all neatly summarized in an easy-to-read table. The dates are easily found on the left side of the table and the aspects on the right. The data on the Main page, will give you insight into the types of date we research for this WebApp. For a more thorough and complete understanding, we encourage all users to attend a class, if and when Geometric Thinking holds another class. As of the date of publication, the last date entered was 06/18/22.\n"
"            * The **CHART** page is self-explanatory. The dates with the highest bars are the dates to watch the most. Note that the EP dates should be viewed as +/- 1 day. In other words, an EP may show up a day before or a day after the highlighted date.\n"
"            The founder of Geometric Thinking (GT) has been involved in the market for a very long time and will not be available to teach for more than a few more years. This WebApp is given to help GT students by giving away some of the insights we PRAYED for, when we were starting out. We wish you the very best success in your trading career! \n"

"\n"
"            We opened Geometric Thinking in July 2017 and have now taught literally hundreds of traders worldwide the art of Geometric Thinking.  \n"
"\n"
"            * Geometric Thinking focuses on a unique understanding of how geometry and natural law focuses the minds of traders (en masse) such that **there are points in time and price where we can forecast trend changes are most likely to occur.**\n"
"\n"
"            * Knowing in advance, for example, that a coin like BTC will likely reach an Energy Point (EP) in time 2 weeks in advance gives the trader almost an “unfair advantage” over other traders. It becomes advantageous for the Geometric Thinker to realize that a projected date 2 weeks in advance is a prime time to observe and plan for, but also analyze the “forecast-able” prices associated with that date.\n"
"            \n"
"            * If you’ve been trading for a while, you already know that this business is cut-throat. It is vicious and even very smart people typically lose everything over time. If you are honest with yourself, you know that **the classic trading techniques, divergences, moving averages, etc. simply do not work consistently.**\n"
"\n"
"            * Therefore, what does work consistently? What will give you an unfair advantage over other traders? **Geometry and natural law.**\n"
"\n"
"            * Having this powerful knowledge will not guarantee that you will win, it gives you an cutting-edge advantage. Look at the picture above of the man holding two aces in the hole. Does this guarantee that he will win the hand? **No. There are still 100 ways to lose, even with a pair of aces in the hole**. If he were playing against other professional poker players he would still need to master the game right? He would still need to hide his tells, learn to bluff, learn game mathematics, etc., to be a consistent winner. The same applies to Geometric Thinking and trading.\n"
"\n"
"            * Now, imagine what Geometric Thinking can do for you. I can give you two Aces on nearly every hand without cheating! **That is a CUTTING-EDGE ADVANTAGE, right?** AstroTool and Geometric Thinking can arrange for you to be dealt two aces in the hole more often than not. If you will combine that with the dedication to master this business, you can become a consistent winner. **We believe this 100%.**\n"

"            Whether you care to believe this or not, dates such as the 12/17/2017 (20k top) or the 15/04/2021 (65k) BTC top were seen weeks in advance as a date for a possible top. The 3/12/2020 low was also forecasted as a possible low well more than a month in advance. **WE LITERALLY [TWEETED TO THE WORLD](https://twitter.com/jimfred1276/status/1462641460948267013), THAT THE NOV 2021 TOP WAS IN, A WEEK OR SO AFTER THE FACT, WHEN PRICE WAS STILL ~ 65000!** To the best of our knowledge, we are the only ones who did that.\n"
"\n"
"            Whether you choose to believe this or not, We assure you it is true that at the very least, **several hundred geometric thinking traders know which dates to watch, and which prices, LONG before other traders do.** \n"

The two developers and students are **[Amir Lehmam](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/amirlehmam)** & **[Sachith Galbokka](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/sachith-galbokka-b22187204)**. Both being passionate about blockchain and programming since they met each others in 2016', they linked their passion with their interest to create this web-app. This was made possible only by our mentor **[Jim Fredrickson](https://geometricthinking.com/about-us/)** - *creator of GeometricThinking.com & AstroTool©* - who allowed us to translate \"Astrotool©\" into Python from his excel sheet which he has been working on since 1991'... We also want to thanks **[Marc Arthure DIAYE](http://marc-arthur.diaye.monsite-orange.fr/)** - *director of the DU Data Analytics at Pantheon Sorbonne* - for allowing us AstroTool© as a memory paper subject!\n"

"            The developers take no credit for the basic calculations and methods of the \"Astrotool©\" algorithm --- It is a complete property of our mentor Jim Fredrickson --- Our job was to translate the entire \"Astrotool\" algorithm into Python in order to make it competitive and up to date. The creation of the Web-App is a major asset for the ease of use of such an algorithm, it was a necessary step for the progress of such a project! A lot of work has been done (about 3 months of intense coding during the summer of 2022...), but the biggest part is still to come! The AstroTool Team has many upcoming ingenious ideas and we will bring astrotool to a level never seen before! Enjoy the Alpha..."

msgid "GeometricThinking is of the opinion that it is FAR better to be **focus on time** as a factor in trading, than to first focus on price. However, forecasting time is much trickier than forecasting price. There are literally **hundreds of hidden variables** that we were never even taught to consider."

msgid "AstroTool© was developed to solve a significant problem for forecasters who are employing natural law (astrology, arithmetic, geometry and universal principles of growth). There are so many factors to consider that it quickly becomes impossible for a serious forecaster to keep a handle on the hundreds of variables that are at work. We found ourselves missing market turns that we had ourselves forecasted in the past, because we got lost in the minutiae of forecasting, along with simply losing track of where we were in real-time. AstroTool has solved this problem."

Those who have taken the time to research the accuracy of Astrotool v5.3 as a forecasting tool have found it to be on the order of **80% accurate in forecasting market turns**. These forecasts are often made months in advance. We invite others to do their own research to see if this statement is self-serving bluster, or is in fact the Truth. **We are confident in what you will find.**"
